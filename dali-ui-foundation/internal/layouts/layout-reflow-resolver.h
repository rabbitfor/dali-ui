/**
 * @brief Finds the closest ancestor that governs a child placed directly under
 * @p start via a SUBTREE-scope LayoutTransition carrying the requested slot
 * effect.
 *
 * The walk encodes the same governed-subtree boundary as
 * @c LayoutTransitionDispatcher::CaptureGovernedChildren (INV-BOUNDARY):
 *
 *  - The CLOSEST transition-bearing node (at or above @p start) is the owner of
 *    the child. It reaches a child placed directly under @p start only when its
 *    scope is @c SUBTREE and it carries the requested slot effect; otherwise the
 *    child is governed directly by that closer node and no inherited dispatch
 *    happens (returns @c nullptr).
 *  - A node with no transition must be a non-standalone container for an ancestor
 *    SUBTREE owner to descend through it. A standalone layout-mode boundary stops
 *    the scope (returns @c nullptr).
 *
 * @note When @p start itself carries a transition that lacks the requested slot
 * effect, the function returns @c nullptr — @p start is the closest owner and an
 * ancestor SUBTREE scope must not cross it. Callers therefore do not need to
 * pre-check @p start; the direct-parent-precedence invariant is enforced here.
 *
 * @param[in] start The child's direct parent (the container the child was added
 *                  to / removed from)
 * @param[in] slot  The structural slot being resolved (ENTER or EXIT)
 * @return The governing owner ViewImpl, or @c nullptr when no SUBTREE owner with
 *         the requested slot effect governs the child
