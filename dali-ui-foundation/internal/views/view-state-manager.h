 * @brief Singleton that serialises View state-change notifications across the main loop thread.
 *
 * Because all Views run on a single thread, one global pending queue is sufficient
 * and avoids per-View overhead.
 *
 * When SetViewState() is called re-entrantly (e.g. a StateChangedSignal handler
 * triggers another state change), the new notification is queued instead of being
 * dispatched immediately.  The outermost caller drains the queue after its own
 * notifications complete, guaranteeing that:
 *  - every handler for transition A→B finishes before any handler for B→C is called.
 *  - handlers always receive the (prev, cur) pair that matches the transition they
 *    were registered for.
