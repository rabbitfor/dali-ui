## Overview

DALi UI provides a focus management system built around two core concepts:

- **FocusManager** — a singleton that controls which View currently has focus
- **View signals** — per-view callbacks for key events, focus changes, and state transitions

Views must have focus to receive key events.

<br/>

## Focus Eligibility

A View can receive focus only when the focus system can resolve it as a valid focus target:

1. The View must be initialized.
2. The View must be attached to the View tree / scene.
3. The View must be visible.
4. The View must be enabled.
5. The View must be focusable. `View` is **not focusable by default**, so call `SetFocusable(true)` unless the View type enables it for you.
6. None of its ancestors may block descendant focus with `SetDescendantFocusBlocked(true)`.

```cpp
View button = View::New()
  .SetFocusable(true);

scene.Add(button);
FocusManager::Get().RequestFocus(button);
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For focus performance, mark containers that never contain focusable descendants with `SetDescendantFocusBlocked(true)`. This lets focus search skip the whole subtree instead of scanning children that cannot receive focus.

> [!NOTE]
> Some Views are focusable by default, such as `InteractiveView` and `InputField`. Calling `AsInteractive()` on a plain View also enables focusable automatically.

### Blocking descendant focus

`SetDescendantFocusBlocked(true)` prevents every descendant of a View from receiving focus:

```cpp
container.SetDescendantFocusBlocked(true);
```

Use this when a subtree is decorative or known not to contain focusable Views. `RequestFocus()`, `SetCurrentFocusView()`, and focus navigation reject descendants under such an ancestor.

<br/>

## Moving Focus

### Programmatic Focus

```cpp
auto focusMgr = FocusManager::Get();

// Set focus directly to one specific View
focusMgr.SetCurrentFocusView(button);

// Or, request focus with child delegation
focusMgr.RequestFocus(containerOrButton);

// Query the currently focused View
View focused = focusMgr.GetCurrentFocusView();

// Clear focus entirely
focusMgr.ClearFocus();
```

### SetCurrentFocusView vs RequestFocus

Use `RequestFocus()` for normal application focus requests. It resolves the request like below:

1. The target View receives a focus request.
2. Layout classes may delegate the request to an eligible focusable descendant.
3. The resolved View is committed as the current focus.
4. The request fails if the target or resolved candidate is blocked, not on scene, disabled, invisible, or not focusable.

Use `SetCurrentFocusView()` when you intentionally want to focus exactly that View with no child delegation. If the View itself is not focusable, the call fails even if it has focusable children.

```cpp
// Delegates to the first focusable child if layout itself is not focusable.
focusMgr.RequestFocus(layout);
```
```cpp
// Tries to focus layout itself. Does not delegate to children.
focusMgr.SetCurrentFocusView(layout);
```

<br/>

### Directional Focus

The framework automatically moves focus when the user presses arrow keys. You can also trigger it in code:

```cpp
focusMgr.MoveFocus(FocusDirection::RIGHT);
focusMgr.MoveFocus(FocusDirection::DOWN);
focusMgr.MoveFocusBackward();  // Return to the previously focused View
```

Available directions: `LEFT`, `RIGHT`, `UP`, `DOWN`, `PAGE_UP`, `PAGE_DOWN`, `FORWARD`, `BACKWARD`, `CLOCKWISE`, `COUNTER_CLOCKWISE`.

<br/>

### Explicit Focus Neighbors

You can wire up directional focus relationships between specific Views:

```cpp
viewA.SetRightFocusableView(viewB);
viewB.SetLeftFocusableView(viewA);
viewA.SetForwardFocusableView(next);
next.SetBackwardFocusableView(viewA);
```

Available setters: `SetLeftFocusableView`, `SetRightFocusableView`, `SetUpFocusableView`, `SetDownFocusableView`, `SetClockwiseFocusableView`, `SetCounterClockwiseFocusableView`, `SetForwardFocusableView`, `SetBackwardFocusableView`.

<br/>

### Focus Groups

```cpp
focusMgr.SetAsFocusGroup(container, true);  // Contain focus within this subtree
```

A focus group is a containment boundary. When focus is inside a `FocusGroup`, default key focus movement is confined to that subtree. Use it for panels, dialogs, popups, or component internals where focus must not escape by arrow keys or Tab / Shift+Tab.

<br/>

## Handling Key Events

A focused View emits `KeyEventSignal` for every key press/release. Return `true` to consume the event (preventing further propagation).

Using a member function:

```cpp
class MyController : public ConnectionTracker
{
public:
  void SetupKeyHandler(View view)
  {
    view.SetFocusable(true);
    view.KeyEventSignal().Connect(this, &MyController::OnKeyEvent);
  }

private:
  bool OnKeyEvent(View view, const KeyEvent& event)
  {
    if(event.GetState() == KeyEvent::State::DOWN)
    {
      if(event.GetKeyName() == "Return")
      {
        // Handle Enter key
        return true;  // consumed
      }
    }
    return false;  // let the event propagate
  }
};
```

The same can be written concisely with a lambda:

```cpp
view.KeyEventSignal().Connect(&tracker, [](View view, const KeyEvent& event) -> bool {
  if(event.GetState() == KeyEvent::State::DOWN)
  {
    if(event.GetKeyName() == "Return")
    {
      // Handle Enter key
      return true;  // consumed
    }
  }
  return false;  // let the event propagate
});
```

<br/>

## Reacting to Focus Changes

### Per-View Signal

```cpp
view.FocusChangedSignal().Connect(&tracker, [](View view, bool focused) {
  if(focused)
  {
    // View just gained focus
  }
  else
  {
    // View just lost focus
  }
});
```

<br/>

### Global Signal (FocusManager)

```cpp
focusMgr.FocusChangedSignal().Connect(&tracker, [](View oldFocus, View newFocus) {
  // Focus moved from oldFocus to newFocus
});
```

<br/>

### Custom Focus Navigation

Override focus navigation for a View subtree by installing a focus navigation callback:

```cpp
View MyFocusNavigation(View currentFocusedView, FocusDirection direction)
{
  if(direction == FocusDirection::RIGHT)
  {
    return FindCustomRightTarget(currentFocusedView);
  }
  return View(); // Empty handle lets parent/default navigation continue.
}

view.SetFocusNavigationCallback(FocusNavigationCallback::New(&MyFocusNavigation));
```

<br/>

## InteractiveView: Clicked & LongPressed signals from Keys

`InteractiveView` converts key events into high-level interactions (click, long-press, pressed state). It is focusable by default and provides `ClickedSignal`, `LongPressedSignal`, and other signals directly:

```cpp
InteractiveView view = InteractiveView::New();

// Control when key-click fires
view.SetKeyClickPolicy(KeyClickPolicy::ON_PRESS);    // Fire Clicked signal on key-down

// Clicked signal — fires on Enter/Return key release (by default)
view.ClickedSignal().Connect(&tracker, [](View v, const InputEvent& event) {
  // Clicked (via touch tap or execution key Enter)
});
```

<br/>

### Making a Plain View Interactive

Even without `InteractiveView`, you can give any `View` the same interaction capabilities by calling `AsInteractive()`. This also enables focusable automatically:

```cpp
View view = View::New();
InteractiveTrait interactive = view.AsInteractive();
interactive.ClickedSignal().Connect(&tracker, [](View v, const InputEvent& event) {
  // Clicked (via touch tap or execution key Enter)
});
```

If no configuration is needed, simply call `view.AsInteractive()` and ignore the returned trait.

<br/>

### Global Defaults via UiConfig

`UiConfig` allows you to set default behavior for all interactive views:

| Setting | Description |
|---|---|
| `SetKeyClickPolicy` | Default key-click timing (ON_RELEASE / ON_PRESS / DISABLED) |
| `SetExecutionKeyPredicate` | Function that determines which keys trigger clicked/long-pressed execution (default: "Return") |
| `SetKeyLongPressThreshold` | Minimum threshold for recognizing a key long-press (number of consecutive key-pressed events) |

```cpp
bool MyKeyPredicate(const Dali::String& keyName)
{
  return keyName == "Return" || keyName == "KP_Enter";
}

UiConfig::New()
  .SetKeyClickPolicy(KeyClickPolicy::ON_RELEASE)   // Fire clicked signal when the key is released
  .SetExecutionKeyPredicate(MyKeyPredicate)        // Treat Return and KP_Enter as click keys
  .SetKeyLongPressThreshold(3)                     // Recognize as long-press when 3+ consecutive key-pressed events are detected
  .Apply();
```

> [!WARNING]
> `SetExecutionKeyPredicate` only accepts a plain function pointer (no capturing lambdas). Pass `nullptr` to restore the default ("Return").
